Hi, Iâ€™m Khushi, you can call me K! I am a final-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi majoring in biotechnology. 
- I am interested in systems and computational neuroscience, neuroimaging, bioinformatics and genetic engineering. I am an aspiring PhD student who hopes to join 
a lab with an amazing collaborative environment where I can attempt to solve interesting neuroscience research questions (like the neuronal basis of differences
in cognition across individuals, does the brain really give rise to consciousness and how, how do we learn and can we make computers do more of our thinking for us 
to get more time for doomscrolling and HOW DOES THE BRAIN WORK??? a.k.a. can I blame all my bad decisions on Sodium influx - Potassium efflux) 
using interdisciplinary experimental and computational approaches and increasingly more unhinged methodolgies until something sticks :) 
- I love creative and technical writing, espeically when I'm free to be as punny as I like.
(This does not apply to my admission essays, I am currently on draft #38538691378438542 of my statement of purpose and hope to never see one againðŸ˜­)
- I love collaborating with people with diverse research interests, please feel free to reach out to me at singhk011235813@gmail.com (Yes, my name is so common I need
to make ids with the Fibonacci sequence.)
- Thank you for visiting my profile! Drop me a mail if you're interested in my work or have cool brain or octopus facts to share!
-K
